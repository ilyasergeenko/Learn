Love my superstitious games
Running circles round my brain when I'm left smiling

I love to steal this living steam
My head in someone's dream
I'm tired of sleeping

Call me crank, my idea
Crank, so super
Crank, my conscience clear

I build my canopy of steel
It fulfills my sense of real
A chrome protection
